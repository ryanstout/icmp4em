    # Create a new ICMP object (host). This takes a host and an optional hash of options for modifying the behavior. They are:
    # * :bind_host
    # Bind the socket to this address. The operating system will figure this out on it's own unless you need to set it for a special situation.
    # * :timeout
    # Timeout, in seconds, before the ping is considered expired and the appropriate callbacks are executed. This should be a numeric class.
    # * :block
    # True or false, default is false. True enables a blocking receive mode, for when accurate latency measurement is important. Due to the nature
    # of event loop architecture, a noticable delay in latency can be added when other things are going on in the reactor.
    # * :interval
    # Interval, in seconds, for how often the ping should be sent. Should be a numeric class.
    # * :stateful
    # True or false, default is false. Indicates whether or not this ping object should keep track of it's successes and failures and execute
    # the on_failure/on_recovery callbacks when the specified limits are hit.
    # * :failures_required
    # Indicates how many consequtive failures are required to switch to the 'failed' state and execute the on_failure callback. Applies only when :stateful => true
    # * :recoveries_required
    # Indicates how many consequtive successes are required to switch to the 'recovered' state and execute the on_recovery callback. Applies only when :stateful => true
